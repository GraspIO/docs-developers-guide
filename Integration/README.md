* You can use it as a content management system for complex data structures and integrate its workbench or editor into your web UI to let your users author content in Grasp.
* You can connect your systems and applications so that the retrieve Grasp model documents or content generated from models and, possibly, subscribe to automatically receive future versions of that content as they become available.
