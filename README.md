Grasp (http://www.grasp.io) is a platform for editing structured content, such as configuration settings or domain-specific language scripts.

It provides guardrails to help with the editing so that even non-technical users can author complex documents and generate code from them.

If you've already read the [Grasp Users Guide](http://www.grasp.io/doc/UsersGuide) you should be familiar with main Grasp concepts, repository organization and basic techniques of using its projectional editor.

This guide covers more advanced topics for those who want to get the maximum value out of Grasp by creating their own grammars, formats and recipes, as well as integrating this tool with exernal systems.
