# Repository and Model Structure

From the user guide you may already know that Grasp stores content in repositories that contain structured documents, called models.

A repository is identified by a unique string GUID.

Repositories belong to teams. A registered user can own or belong to multiple teams and will have read-write access to all their repositories.

In addition, registered users and anonymous visitors can access repositories that belong to other teams, as long as they are marked as public.

For each user Grasp creates a private representation of the repository called workbench. It contains user changes until they have been published into the repository where other users can see them.
